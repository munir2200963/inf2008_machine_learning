Planned Slide Content:
 
- feature extraction: voiceprint extraction using ecapa-tdnn & prosody extraction using tacatron
 
- feature engineering: added in features using manhanttan dist and cluster. we will be backing on why this features are needed using a correlation matrix.
 
- model training: SVM, XGBoost, LogReg and gridsearch/bayesian search
 
- evaluation: evaluate using EER, compare all models
 
- optimisation: implement in C to show improvements in speed
 
- reporting: summarise results, show that we beat baseline model, do demo showcasing how our model work
 
future works: augment data with noise, reverb, speed and pitch, also use MLFlow to show that you systematically compare results.
