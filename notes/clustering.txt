## Clearly Restated Solution:

Your proposed approach is:

- During **inference (testing pipeline)**, perform a **separate HDBSCAN clustering** specifically on the **enroll utterances of the test set only** (no trial utterances involved at this stage).
- After creating these clusters from enroll embeddings, you assign each **trial utterance** (one by one) to these established clusters.
- Generate a **new feature** based on whether a given **trial utterance and its corresponding enroll utterance belong to the same cluster**.

The assumption here is that the process to assign (or map) a new trial utterance to a pre-computed cluster from enroll utterances is straightforward (e.g., nearest centroid or nearest neighbor assignment).

## Evaluation of This Revised Solution:

### ‚úÖ **Advantages:**

- **No Data Leakage:**  
  Clustering only the enroll embeddings ensures there's no leakage from trial embeddings. You never let the trial embeddings influence the clustering, preserving evaluation integrity.

- **Good Generalization at Test Time:**  
  This approach generalizes cleanly, as clusters represent genuine speaker-specific distributions computed exclusively from enroll embeddings at inference.

- **Practical Real-world Alignment:**  
  Reflects realistic deployment scenarios where you cluster only speaker enrollment data, then assign new incoming utterances.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues and Considerations:**

- **Few enroll embeddings per speaker:**  
  If there are very few enrollment embeddings per speaker in the test set, the density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) may struggle to form stable clusters or might label some enroll embeddings as noise.

- **Difficulty assigning trial embeddings reliably:**  
  If clusters from enroll embeddings are too tight or sparse, trial embeddings may frequently be labeled as noise or incorrectly assigned to clusters.

- **Possibly inconsistent clusters across training and testing:**  
  Clusters created from enroll embeddings of the training set may differ substantially from clusters from enroll embeddings of the test set, causing inconsistency or unpredictability in evaluation and inference behavior.

## üìå **Conclusion: Will This Solution Work?**

Yes, your revised solution can potentially work well, as it completely avoids the critical data-leakage issue. This is a valid and practically reasonable approach, provided that:

- You have enough enroll embeddings per speaker to form stable and meaningful clusters.
- You have a clear method (e.g., nearest neighbor, centroid-based assignment) to reliably assign each trial embedding to these enroll-based clusters.

However, be cautious:

- **Cluster assignment stability:** HDBSCAN doesn‚Äôt inherently provide a direct prediction step (like KMeans). You‚Äôll need a stable method to assign new embeddings, such as using the nearest cluster centroid or nearest-neighbor assignment.
- If clusters are unstable or overly sparse, consider adjusting clustering parameters or using more robust assignment methods.

## üö© **Recommended Practical Implementation:**

A practical and reliable workflow might be:

1. **Cluster Enroll Embeddings:** Use HDBSCAN on enroll embeddings of your test set to create clusters.
2. **Derive Cluster Representatives:** For each cluster (identified by HDBSCAN), compute centroids or representative embeddings.
3. **Assign Trial Utterances:** For each trial embedding, measure distance (e.g., Euclidean or cosine) to each cluster centroid or representative, assigning the trial embedding to the closest one.
4. **Generate the "Cluster Match" Feature:** The new binary feature indicates if the trial embedding and its claimed speaker's enroll embedding belong to the same cluster.

This practical method provides robustness, reproducibility, and realistic inference conditions.
